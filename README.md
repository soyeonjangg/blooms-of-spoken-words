# Blooms of Spoken Words

An interactive artwork project as part of CS889: Art and Creativity at the University of Waterloo by Professor Dan Vogel.

## Overview 
Blooms of Spoken Words is an interactive mirror that transforms speech into living symbols, making emotion and self-perception visible and tangible. The mirror listens to spoken language, analyzes its emotional sentiment through a Large Language Model (LLM), and generates symbolic visual responses—flowers that bloom for all sentiments, and black squares that appear or disappear based on the intensity of negativity or positivity—inspired by the traditional language of flowers.
